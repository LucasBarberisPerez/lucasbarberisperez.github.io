    info: `<p>
            I started in the tech world as a <strong>systems technician</strong> in 2017. Thanks to scripting and automating tasks in Linux, I became curious about programming and ended up studying <strong>Web Application Development</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
            After finishing my studies, I couldn't find a direct job opportunity in the field, so I started working on my own, doing <strong>freelance jobs and projects</strong> as a web developer.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm currently focused on <strong>backend development</strong>, though I'm open to learning *whatever is needed*. I've always learned on my own, *trying new things* and *adapting to different work environments*.
            </p>`,
